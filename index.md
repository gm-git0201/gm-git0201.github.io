# My Portfolio

My name is Georgia Harvison-Miles and I am currently attending CalState Fullerton University. My major is Electrical Engineering and I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's degree in 2026.

## Lab Reflection

Lab 4 

My first favorite lab is Lab 4, part 2. The code was engaging with the if statements, and I remember not having a too difficult time writing it. Being tasked with making a simple guessing game was fun. 

Lab 6 

My second favorite lab is Lab 6 and both parts. They both had their challenges, but I eventually was able to figure them out. I really liked how much more engaging the code is when running the program. Making the sandwich and playing some blackjack seems so simple, but there is a lot of background calculating from the computer to do what it needs to do. 

Lab 12 

My third and last favorite lab is Lab 12. At this point, writing the code was just a review over the semester on what we learned, and I enjoyed it as much as I was pulling my hair out. It wasn’t too difficult, but the inconsistencies within the code were a little frustrating. It is offset with me having that “Ah Hah!” moment when I figure it out. The instructions were very clear too, so I didn’t have too many problems with it.
